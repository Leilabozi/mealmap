## Evaluating top 3 ideas 

1. Meal prep app  Mobile
✅ Uniquely mobile: 
Yes — benefits from mobile notifications, camera (for taking pictures of meals), location (e.g., nearby grocery stores), and push reminders.
Beyond a website: Yes — having it in your pocket while shopping, cooking, or planning is key.
✅ Story
Compelling use case: Yes — clear value for people who meal prep or want to start. Strong productivity/health angle.
Peer reaction: Likely very positive, especially among students or fitness-focused peers who already do it or want to start.
✅ Market
Size: Medium-large. Health-conscious people, students, working professionals, gym-goers.
Niche value: Yes — especially if you tailor it to specific dietary needs (e.g., vegan, high-protein, budget meals).
✅ Habit
Usage frequency: High — daily or weekly use for planning, grocery shopping, cooking.
Creation over consumption: Yes — users input meals, recipes, grocery lists.
✅ Scope
Feasible MVP: Yes — a stripped-down version with recipes + shopping list + weekly planner is very doable.
Well-defined: Yes — you can narrow scope easily, and gather classmate feedback 

2.  Internship/Job Application Tracker App
🟡 Mobile
Uniquely mobile: Less so — mostly input + tracking, could be done via spreadsheet or desktop app.
Beyond website: Slightly. Mobile reminders, real-time status updates, and camera (e.g., save offer letters or company cards) could help.
✅ Story
Compelling: Yes, especially for students navigating applications.
Peers: They might say “I already use Google Sheets,” but may like an app that’s more visual or reminder-focused.
🟡 Market
Size: Medium. Only really helpful to job/internship seekers.
Niche value: Yes — if it handles interviews, deadlines, resume versions, and recruiter contacts well.
🟡 Habit
Usage frequency: Moderate — bursts of activity during job hunting seasons, then drops off.
Consumption/creation: Mostly input-based.
✅ Scope
Feasible MVP: Yes — even basic version (tracker + status + reminders) is useful.
Well-defined: Could be, but not very “exciting” in mobile-specific features.

3. Journaling App
✅ Mobile
Uniquely mobile: Yes — good for capturing thoughts anywhere, using voice-to-text, photos, even location mood-tracking.
Beyond website: Yes, if you leverage mobile features like audio entries, camera prompts, or notifications.
✅ Story
Compelling: Moderate — some people may not see the value, but those who journal could love a smart, mobile-first solution.
Peers: Mixed. Some will love it, others still prefer paper.
✅ Market
Size: Medium-large. Many mental health, mindfulness, and productivity apps succeed in this space.
Niche value: Could be big with unique features — e.g., auto-prompts, mental health tracking, private voice memos.
✅ Habit
Usage frequency: Medium to high if done right — daily journaling is a habit.
Consumption/creation: High creation component — users generate content.
✅ Scope
Feasible MVP: Yes — journaling with prompts + text entry + search/history is simple to build.
Expandable: Yes — add sentiment analysis, graphs, media later.

## The Final Decision
Meal Prep App - practical, habit-forming, clearly needed, and technically scoped.
